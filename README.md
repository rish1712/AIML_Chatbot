# AIML_Chatbot
## Summary
This is a part of the *CS F407 Artificial Intelligence* Course at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. In this assignment, a messenger bot  is created which can provide intelligent dialog conversations with the user, similar to  [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) or [ALICE](https://www.chatbots.org/chatbot/a.l.i.c.e/).

### Features
- AIML is used for the core of the chatbot.
- The messenger bot uses a knowledge base with multiple random responses exchanged between the user and the bot. 
- The bot is able to give replies to multiple interactions and stores the conversations in a  database. These persistent copies of the interactions can be retrieved the next time user chats with the  bot.
- The bot interacts with web services and helps an helps Alheimerâ€™s patients (a disease that causes patients to struggle with short-term memory loss). 
- The bot can interact with Google Maps using API calls and can display previous chats history. 
- **No machine learning is used and the whole project is based on keyword matching and intent recognition.**
